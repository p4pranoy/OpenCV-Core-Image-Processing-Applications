This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`OpenCV Core Image Processing Applications.ipynb`) demonstrating **core image processing techniques** using **OpenCV** in Python.

## Project Overview

This notebook serves as a practical guide to fundamental image processing operations, focusing on techniques like **simple thresholding**. It illustrates how to load images, convert them to grayscale, apply thresholding to segment regions, and visualize the processed outputs.

## Key Highlights

  * **Image Loading**: Learn to load images into your Python environment using OpenCV.
  * **Grayscale Conversion**: Understand how to convert color images to grayscale.
  * **Simple Thresholding**: Apply basic thresholding to images for binary segmentation.
  * **Image Display**: Display original and processed images for visual comparison.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you will need to have Python and the `opencv-python` library installed. If you are using Google Colab, `cv2_imshow` is used for displaying images.

You can install OpenCV via pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### How to Run

1.  Place an image file (e.g., `dog.jpg` as suggested by the notebook content) in the same directory as the notebook, or update the image path within the notebook.

2.  Open the notebook using Jupyter:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "OpenCV Core Image Processing Applications.ipynb"
    ```

3.  Execute the cells sequentially to see the image processing techniques in action.
