# This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (OpenCV Core Image Processing Applications.ipynb) demonstrating core image processing techniques using OpenCV in Python.

Project Overview
-
This notebook serves as a practical guide to fundamental image processing operations, focusing on techniques like simple thresholding. It illustrates how to load images, convert them to grayscale, apply thresholding to segment regions, and visualize the processed outputs.

Key Highlights
Image Loading: Learn to load images into your Python environment using OpenCV.

Grayscale Conversion: Understand how to convert color images to grayscale.

Simple Thresholding: Apply basic thresholding to images for binary segmentation.

Image Display: Display original and processed images for visual comparison.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you will need to have Python and the opencv-python library installed. If you are using Google Colab, cv2_imshow is used for displaying images.

You can install OpenCV via pip:

Bash

pip install opencv-python
How to Run
Place an image file (e.g., dog.jpg as suggested by the notebook content) in the same directory as the notebook, or update the image path within the notebook.

Open the notebook using Jupyter:

Bash

jupyter notebook "OpenCV Core Image Processing Applications.ipynb"
Execute the cells sequentially to see the image processing techniques in action.
